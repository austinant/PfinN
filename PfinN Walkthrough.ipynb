The dissertation itself lends more time to theoretical matters and to proofs; here, I would like to focus instead on the computational tools that helped me formulate conjectures that eventually became the main results of my thesis (and maybe some other less-than-resolved conjectures).  Also, since this flavor of mathematics does not require extensive background, I see this as an opportunity to present some combinatorial factorization theory to any curious individuals who may not identify as mathematicians.\n",

    "5. Return **factorizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs slowly for a couple reasons.  First (and probably most importantly), in step 2, we are required to find all of the atoms which are subsets of $X$.  $X$ has a lot of subsets ($2^{|X|}$ of them, to be precise), and we essentially have to check whether each of them is an atom.  This check is a fairly involved computational step, which relies on brute force (one has to check all possible subsets of $B$ and $C$ to see whether $A = B+C$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second contributing factor is the recursive nature of the algorithm (see step 4).  This in itself isn't necessarily harmful to the runtime, but it does compound the problem of checking whether some sets are atoms.  Since the $B$ in step 4 is a subset of $X\\!:\\! A$ (which is a subset of $A$), we have already checked (in step 2) whether each subset of $B$ is an atom but will have to do so again (when we apply the algorithm directly to $B$).  So, not only is checking for atoms a lot of work, but we are duplicating some portion of that work!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recording Atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "The major problem of the brute force algorithm lies in having to check whether each subset of the input set is an atom.  To get around this, we can try to record a list of atoms beforehand, and then reference it as needed.  We still have to check whether each of a large collection of sets is an atom, but we can save the results of this work for later use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recording atoms is its own sizeable task, and understanding the distribution of atoms among all subsets requires us to contemplate many hard (but interesting) questions.  To begin, even if we do wish to write down all the atoms (keeping in mind there are infinitely many of them) how can we systematically write them down so that, if we are looking for a specific atom, we may find it?  We can \"order\" them by their largest element.  For example, $\\{0,1,3\\}$ is an atom, and so is $\\{0,5\\}$.  In our master list of all atoms, we could say that $\\{0,1,3\\}$ comes before $\\{0,5\\}$ because its maximum element is smaller.  In other words, we can stratify the collection of all atoms by maximum element.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, it makes sense to produce a series of lists of all atoms with maximum element equal to $n$ (each of these lists will be finite), and then let $n$ range as large as we can conceivably need (or as large as we can conceivably compute).  This is essentially the approach I took.  In the repository, we have files atoms_max1.txt,atoms_max2.txt,... containing lists of atoms with maximum element 1,2, and so on.  However, the script record_atoms.py can be used to generate lists with max as large as you need *\n",
    "\n",
    "** However, this can take considerable time and computing power.  This repository comes with files up to atoms_max22.txt, and my local directory has up to atoms_max27.txt.  To do this, I took advantage of multiprocessing and the OSU Math Department's computing cluster, which gave me the ability to parallelize this process over 48 cores.  Compiling the lists of atoms with maximum $n=27$ took a little longer than a month under these conditions (and the time more than triples each time $n$ is incremented up).  Additionally, the files are large and storage becomes a practical concern.*"
