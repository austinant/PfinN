    "In this notebook are some examples and explanations of functions I wrote to help with my dissertation research.  The dissertation itself lends more time to theoretical matters and to proofs; here, I would like to focus instead on the computational tools that helped me formulate conjectures that eventually became the main results of my thesis (and maybe some other less-than-resolved conjectures).  Also, since this flavor of mathematics does not require extensive background, I see this as an opportunity to present some combinatorial factorization theory to any curious individuals who may not identify as mathematicians.\n",

Further theoretical discussion of power monoids can be found in [my joint paper with Salvo](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10913), which makes up the first couple chapters of my [dissertation](https://github.com/austinant/thesis/blob/master/AAA%20Dissertation.pdf).\n",

So we should try decomposing $Z$ into parts which can't be decomposed further; these will be called atoms.\n",
